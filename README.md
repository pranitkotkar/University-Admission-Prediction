# University-Admission-Prediction

I have trained regression models to find the probability of a student getting accepted into a particular university based on their profile. This project could be practically used to get the university acceptance rate for individual students using web application.

The factors used to determine the chances are..
GRE score (out of 340)
TOEFL score (out of 120)
University Rating (1 to 5)
No. of LOR (upto 5)
SOP rating (upto 5)
CGPA (out of 10)
Research experience (0 or 1)
Various Regression model built are..
Linear Regression accuracy: 81.99%
Artificial Neural Network accuracy: 79.34%
Decision Tree accuracy: 49.00%
Random Forest accuracy: 79.77%
The highest accuracy was obtained was 81.99% for the Linear Regression model

various regression models KPIs
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) = 5.6%
MSE (Mean Squared Error) = 0.31%
MAE (Mean Absolute Error) = 4.16%
R2 ( R Squared) = 81.99%
Adjusted R2 = 80.11%
