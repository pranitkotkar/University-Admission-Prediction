# University-Admission-Prediction

I have trained regression models to find the probability of a student getting accepted into a particular university based on their profile.

### The factors used to determine the chances are:-
1. GRE score (out of 340)
2. TOEFL score (out of 120)
3. University Rating (1 to 5)
4. No. of LOR (upto 5)
5. SOP rating (upto 5)
6. CGPA (out of 10)
7. Research experience (0 or 1)

### Various Regression model built are:-
1. Linear Regression accuracy: 81.99%
2. Artificial Neural Network accuracy: 79.34%
3. Decision Tree accuracy: 49.00%
4. Random Forest accuracy: 79.77%

The highest accuracy obtained was 81.99% for the Linear Regression model

### various regression models KPIs
1. RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) = 5.6%
2. MSE (Mean Squared Error) = 0.31%
3. MAE (Mean Absolute Error) = 4.16%
4. R2 ( R Squared) = 81.99%
5. Adjusted R2 = 80.11%
